# Context7 Usage Rule

Always use Context7 MCP when need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without the user having to explicitly ask.

## When to Use Context7

- Looking up API documentation for any library/framework
- Generating code that uses external libraries
- Setting up new dependencies or configurations
- Checking best practices for library usage
- Verifying correct syntax or method signatures
- Finding code examples for implementation

## How to Use

1. First call `resolve-library-id` to get the Context7-compatible library ID
2. Then call `query-docs` with the library ID and your specific question

## Examples

- Setting up pytest fixtures → Query pytest docs
- Using Click for CLI → Query click docs
- Async programming with asyncio → Query asyncio docs
- Any new library being added to the project → Query its docs first
