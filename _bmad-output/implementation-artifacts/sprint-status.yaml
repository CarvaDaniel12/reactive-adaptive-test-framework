# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

  # 🔴 HIGH SEVERITY - Must Fix
  high_severity:
    - id: CR-HIGH-001
      status: done  # Fixed 2026-01-05
      title: "API Key não criptografada no storage"
      file: "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
      fix_applied: |
        - Added get_encryption_key() to use Encryptor from qa-pms-config
        - configure_ai now encrypts API key before storage
        - get_decrypted_api_key() retrieves and decrypts from DB
        - Falls back to env var for backwards compatibility

    - id: CR-HIGH-002
      status: done  # Fixed 2026-01-05
      title: "SQL Injection potencial em repository"
      file: "crates/qa-pms-support/src/repository.rs"
      fix_applied: |
        - Added Display impl for ErrorStatus, ErrorSeverity, ErrorSource
        - Changed format!("{:?}", ...) to .to_string()
        - Enums now properly serialize to snake_case

    - id: CR-HIGH-003
      status: done  # Fixed 2026-01-05
      title: "Missing input validation para API key"
      file: "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
      fix_applied: |
        - Added validate_api_key() function
        - Checks minimum length (20 chars)
        - Validates provider-specific prefixes (sk-*, sk-ant-*)
        - Returns clear error messages

    - id: CR-HIGH-004
      status: pending
      title: "Missing rate limiting em endpoints AI"
      file: "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
      note: |
        - Not implemented yet (dependency is currently commented out)
        - Per tower-governor docs, Axum integration can use GovernorLayer and/or custom error_handler
        - Prefer per-route limits for /api/v1/ai/* endpoints

    - id: CR-HIGH-005
      status: pending
      title: "AI config storage broken: api_key_encrypted BYTEA vs Encryptor returns hex string"
      files:
        - "migrations/20260105000005_ai_config_schema.sql"
        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
      evidence: |
        - DB schema: ai_configs.api_key_encrypted is BYTEA
        - Encryptor.encrypt() returns hex-encoded String
        - routes/ai.rs binds api_key_encrypted as Option<String> in SELECT and binds String in INSERT
        - This will fail at runtime (type mismatch) and may silently break AI features
      fix: |
        - Align DB type to TEXT (store hex string), OR change Encryptor to return Vec<u8> and store BYTEA
        - Update queries to use correct SQLx types (Option<String> for TEXT or Option<Vec<u8>> for BYTEA)

    - id: CR-HIGH-006
      status: pending
      title: "AI BYOK is not per-user: uses user_id NULL and ON CONFLICT(user_id) won't upsert"
      files:
        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
        - "migrations/20260105000005_ai_config_schema.sql"
      evidence: |
        - routes/ai.rs uses user_id IS NULL everywhere (singleton/global config)
        - user_id has UNIQUE constraint; NULL does not conflict in Postgres unique indexes
        - INSERT ... ON CONFLICT(user_id) DO UPDATE will not fire for NULL and can create multiple rows
      fix: |
        - Make AI config per authenticated user_id (preferred), OR enforce a true singleton row (e.g., unique index on (COALESCE(user_id, '000...')))
        - Update SELECT/UPDATE queries accordingly

    - id: CR-HIGH-007
      status: pending
      title: "Missing AI Settings UI (Provider/Model/API key management) despite API endpoints"
      files:
        - "frontend/src/components/ai/AIChatbot.tsx"
        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/ai.rs"
      evidence: |
        - Frontend only calls /api/v1/ai/status + /ai/chat; no UI to call /ai/providers /ai/configure /ai/test /ai/disable
        - AIChatbot tells user to configure in Settings, but no Settings page exists
      fix: |
        - Add minimal AI settings page (provider list + model select + masked API key input + test + save + disable)
        - Or integrate into existing Setup wizard (optional step) if that matches product flow

    - id: CR-HIGH-008
      status: done  # Fixed 2026-01-07
      title: "Setup integration tests are stubbed (Postman/Testmo) despite existing crates"
      files:
        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/setup.rs"
      evidence: |
        - routes/setup.rs: test_postman and test_testmo endpoints still simulate success and have TODOs
        - This undermines setup validation UX and contradicts integration readiness expectations
      fix: |
        - Wire setup test endpoints to qa-pms-postman and qa-pms-testmo clients for real validation
        - Return concrete error messages + suggestions
      fix_applied: |
        - Replaced simulated Postman/Testmo success with real health checks:
          - Postman: qa_pms_postman::PostmanHealthCheck (/me)
          - Testmo: qa_pms_testmo::TestmoHealthCheck (/api/v1/user)
        - Store credentials in setup state only when health check is Online/Degraded
        - Return response-time based success messages and propagate integration error_message on failure

      files:
        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/setup.rs"
      evidence: |
        - complete_setup validates config fields and writes YAML
        - It does not run the integration validation/health checks described in the story acceptance criteria
      fix: |
        - Invoke StartupValidator (or dedicated validation) during complete_setup and surface results in response
      fix_applied: |
        - Added StartupValidator execution during POST /api/v1/setup/complete
        - Uses JiraHealthCheck (critical, API token auth only) + Postman/Testmo health checks (optional)
        - Returns startupValidation report in response; blocks completion only on critical failure

      note: "Story 2.7 was updated and synced on 2026-01-07; remaining listed stories still need sync."
      evidence: |
        - Several story files still show Status: ready-for-dev and unchecked tasks, but sprint-status marks them done
      fix: |
        - Update story Status/Tasks + Dev Agent Record, or run BMAD code-review per story and sync statuses

      fix: |
        - Remove expect/unwrap in production code
        - In tests: prefer Result-returning tests or add local #[allow(clippy::unwrap_used)] / #[allow(clippy::expect_used)] where justified

        - "crates/qa-pms-api/src/routes/setup.rs"
        - "crates/qa-pms-jira/src/oauth.rs"
      evidence: |
        - Wizard UI collects client_id/client_secret and stores them, but doesn't execute OAuth callback to obtain cloud_id/access_token
        - Startup health validation requires an access token for OAuth (JiraHealthCheck::with_oauth)
      fix: |
        - Either implement the full OAuth flow in the wizard (authorize → callback → store cloud_id/access_token), OR
        - Hide/disable OAuth option until supported; keep API token as the supported path

    - id: CR-MED-017

        - "migrations/20260105000002_time_aggregates_schema.sql"
      evidence: |
        - Aggregation functions existed (record_workflow_completion + SQL functions) but were not invoked from workflow completion.
        - Dashboard endpoints prefer time_daily_aggregates; without updates, dashboards fall back to less accurate calculations.
      fix_applied: |
        - Wired `record_workflow_completion()` into `POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/complete` (background task)
        - Computes actual_seconds from time_sessions and estimated_seconds from workflow template steps
        - Derives deterministic UUIDv5 for user_id from workflow instance user_id string (to satisfy UUID schema)
