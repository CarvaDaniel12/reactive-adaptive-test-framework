# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

        Integration Health Check Fix:
        
        ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
        - StartupValidator was created empty - integrations not connected
        - HealthScheduler was declared but never started
        - Jira used OAuth only, but API Token is simpler
        
        FIXES APPLIED:
        1. JiraSettings updated to support both API Token and OAuth:
           - JIRA_URL, JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN (recommended)
           - JIRA_CLIENT_ID, JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET, JIRA_REDIRECT_URI (alternative)
        
        2. JiraHealthCheck refactored:
           - with_api_token() - Basic Auth with email:token (recommended)
           - with_oauth() - Bearer token for OAuth apps
        
        3. JiraTicketsClient refactored:
           - with_api_token() constructor for API Token auth
           - with_oauth() constructor for OAuth auth
           - Updated to /rest/api/3/search/jql (deprecated /search removed)
        
        4. user_config.rs refactored:
           - JiraAuthInput enum (ApiToken | OAuth)
           - JiraAuthType enum for stored config
           - JiraConfig supports both auth methods
        
        5. app.rs updated:
           - create_startup_validator() adds Jira (critical), Postman/Testmo (optional)
           - create_health_scheduler() creates periodic monitoring
           - main.rs starts HealthScheduler as background task
        
        TESTED WITH REAL JIRA API:
        - Authentication: PASS (daniel@hostfully.com)
        - Search tickets: PASS (project=PMP)
        - Get ticket details: PASS (PMP-15214)
        
        ARCHITECTURE NOW:
        - Jira: CRITICAL (blocks startup if fails)
        - Postman: Optional (warning only)
        - Testmo: Optional (warning only)
        - HealthScheduler: 60s interval monitoring
